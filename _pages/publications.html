<p>Recent research underscores the substantial influence of automated vehicles (AVs) on traffic flow stability. Despite the widespread application of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) as a longitudinal AV technology, there remain several aspects of the system that are not fully understood, primarily due to the absence of extensive field data for accurate modeling. In response, we conducted a series of novel experiments using two ACC-equipped vehicles to replicate the behavior of AV platoons in real-world scenarios. The experiments incorporated a linear car-following controller within the upper-layer system to evaluate the string stability of the ACC vehicle platoon. Data were collected via the vehicles' GPS sensors and the upper-level controllers. These data are instrumental in estimating feedback delays within the upper layer and identifying parasitic lags in the lower layer.</p>
