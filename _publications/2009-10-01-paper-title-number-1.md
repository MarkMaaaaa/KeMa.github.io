# ULTra-AV: A Unified Longitudinal Trajectory Dataset for Automated Vehicles

Automated Vehicles (AVs) promise significant advances in transportation. Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, which heavily relies on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AVs, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development.

This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (ULTra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. The dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experimental scenarios.

### Data Processing Overview

- **Step 1:** Extraction of longitudinal trajectory data.
- **Step 2:** General data cleaning.
- **Step 3:** Data-specific cleaning for longitudinal trajectory and car-following data.

The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of relationships between variables in car-following models.

This work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.
